NODE PROCESSES
Example:
- 1 node
- 2 applications
  - each Node has multiple Pods on it
  - 3 processes must be installed on every Node
  - Worker Nodes do the actual work

Container runtime:
- Containerd
- Docker
- Cri-o

Kubelet:
- Interacts with both the container and node
- Kubelet starts the pod with a container inside

Kube Proxy:
- Must be installed on all nodes 
- Forwards the requests

SUMMARIZE:
3 Node Processes:
- Kubelet (on all nodes)
- Kube Proxy (on all nodes)
- Container runtime
Managing processes are done by Master Nodes

MASTER PROCESSES
4 processes run on every master node
- API SERVER via client - cluster gateway / acts as a gatekeeper for authentication!
- SCHEDULAR = just decides on which node new Pod should be scheduled. Schedule new Pod --> API Server --> Scheduler --> Where to put the Pod? --> Kubelet
- CONTROLLER MANAGER = Controller Manager --> Scheduler --> Kubelets (Reschedule the dead Pods)
- ETCD = the cluster brain / Cluster changes get stored in the key value store / Application data is NOT stored in etcd!

Example Cluster Set-Up
2 Masters Nodes
3 Worker Nodes

Add new Master/Node server:
- Get new bare server
- Install all the master/worker node processes
- add it to the cluster
