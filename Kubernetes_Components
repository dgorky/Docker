NODE and POD:

NODE
- Physical server
- Virtual machine

POD
- Smallest unit of K8s
- Abstraction over container
- Usually 1 application per Pod
- Each Pod gets its own IP address
- New IP address on re-creation

SERVICE
- Permanent IP address
- load balancer
- Lifecycle of Pod Service NOT connection
External service
- Service that opens the communication from external sources
Internal service
- Service is from internal sources

INGRESS
- Request first goes to Ingress and does the forwarding to the service

CONFIGMAP
- External configuration of your application
- DON'T put credentials into ConfigMap

SECRET
- used to store secret data
- base64 encoded
- the built-in security mechanism is not enabled by default!

VOLUMES
- Local = Storage on local machine
- Remote = or remote, outside of the K8s cluster
- K8s doesn't manage data persistance!

DEPLOYMENT
- blueprint for my-app pods
- you create Deployments / replicate and scale the pods down or up
- abstraction of Pods
- In practice you would work often with Deployments rather than Pods
- Databases can't be replicated via Deployments!

STATEFULSET
- for STATEFUL apps
- Deployment for stateLESS apps
- StatefulSet for stateful apps or Databases
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- Elastic

MAIN KUBERNETES COMPONENTS SUMMARIZED
Pod = abstraction of containers
Service = communication
Ingress = route traffic into cluster
ConfigMap = external configuration
Volumes = Storage for data
Deployments = Pods blueprints
StatefulSet = Specifically used for databases
